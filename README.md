A powerful VS Code extension that provides smart function folding capabilities for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python files. Focus on your code structure by folding only function definitions while keeping other code blocks visible.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üéØ Function-only folding**: Intelligently fold only function definitions
- **üîç Smart pattern matching**: Supports all modern JavaScript/TypeScript function patterns
- **‚ö° Quick shortcuts**: Fold/unfold with customizable keyboard shortcuts
- **üì± Context menu**: Right-click integration for easy access
- **üåê Multi-language support**: Works with JS, TS, JSX, TSX, and Python files
- **üé® Clean interface**: Seamless integration with VS Code's native folding

### Supported Function Patterns

**JavaScript & TypeScript:**

- Regular function declarations: `function myFunction() {}`
- Arrow functions: `const myFunc = () => {}`
- Method shorthand: `{ methodName() {} }`
- Class methods: `class MyClass { method() {} }`
- Async functions: `async function myAsyncFunc() {}`
- TypeScript methods with modifiers: `public async method(): Promise<void> {}`
- Export functions: `export function myFunc() {}`

**Python:**

- Function definitions: `def my_function():`
- Async functions: `async def my_async_function():`
- Class methods: `def method(self):`
- Static methods: `@staticmethod def my_method():`
- Class methods: `@classmethod def my_method(cls):`
- Decorated functions: `@decorator def my_function():`

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Open any JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python file
3. Use `Ctrl+Alt+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+F` (Mac) to fold all functions
4. Use `Ctrl+Alt+U` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+U` (Mac) to unfold all functions

## üìã Usage

| Command                  | Shortcut (Windows/Linux) | Shortcut (Mac) | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fold All Functions**   | `Ctrl+Alt+F`             | `Cmd+Alt+F`    | Fold all function definitions in the active file |
| **Unfold All Functions** | `Ctrl+Alt+U`             | `Cmd+Alt+U`    | Unfold all folded regions in the active file     |

### Context Menu

Right-click in any JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python file to access folding commands from the context menu.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: The extension doesn't fold my functions**
A: Make sure you're in a supported file type (JS, TS, JSX, TSX, Python). Check that your functions match the supported patterns.

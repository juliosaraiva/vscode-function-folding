# 🚀 GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Summary

## ✅ What's Been Created

Your Function Folding extension now has a complete, professional-grade CI/CD pipeline with the following components:

### 🔄 Automated Workflows

1. **CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Runs on every push and pull request
   - Tests on multiple Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x)
   - Performs linting, compilation, and testing
   - Security audits and vulnerability checks
   - Packages extension and uploads artifacts

2. **Release Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
   - Triggers automatically on version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
   - Creates GitHub releases with changelog
   - Publishes to VS Code Marketplace
   - Publishes to Open VSX Registry
   - Uploads .vsix files as release assets

3. **Code Quality Checks** (`.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`)
   - Comprehensive linting and formatting analysis
   - Bundle size monitoring
   - Security scanning
   - Automated PR comments with quality reports

4. **Dependency Management** (`.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`)
   - Weekly automated dependency updates
   - Security vulnerability fixes
   - Automated pull requests for updates

5. **Version Management** (`.github/workflows/version-bump.yml`)
   - Manual version bumping (patch/minor/major)
   - Automatic CHANGELOG.md updates
   - Tag creation and release drafting

### 📁 Configuration Files

- **`.vscodeignore`** - Controls what files are excluded from extension package
- **`.prettierrc`** - Code formatting rules
- **`.prettierignore`** - Files to exclude from formatting
- **Enhanced `.gitignore`** - Comprehensive ignore patterns
- **Updated `package.json`** - New scripts for formatting, testing, and releasing

## 🛠️ Next Steps

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets (Required)

```bash
# Go to GitHub Repository Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions
# Add these secrets:
VSCE_PAT=your_vs_code_marketplace_token
OVSX_PAT=your_open_vsx_token  # Optional
```

### 2. Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)

- Go to Settings → Branches
- Add protection rule for `main` branch
- Require status checks before merging

### 3. Test the Pipeline

```bash
# Create a test commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main

# Watch the Actions tab for workflow execution
```

### 4. Create Your First Release

```bash
# Method 1: Use the automated workflow
# Go to Actions → Version Bump → Run workflow

# Method 2: Manual tag creation
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```
